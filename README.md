# Tableau-Data-Visualization-BK

Using Tableau to create data visualization with interactive and analysis graph

1. The first project was related to Marketing analysis for a University in Singapore, National University of Singapore(NUS) https://public.tableau.com/profile/brian.kurniawan#!/vizhome/Group22FinalRevision/Story1)

  (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-suss-sutd)
  From online data base source provided by the government, I have to focus on two important variables on detemrining
  how successful is a school and a program within school. Monthly salary and employement rate are the two most signifacnt indicators 
  on this project, with data from 700 students from 2014-2018, I have to provide deeper analysis why NUS is better than the other University.
  
  
  
 2. The second project was related to marketing analysis for Superstore office ecommerce company.(https://public.tableau.com/profile/brian.kurniawan#!/vizhome/BrianKurniawanDataVisualizationFinalProject/BrianKurniawanSuperstoreProject)
    With sales over at 49 states and 17 products in their catalog, Superstore has to decide how their marketing campaign will be structured and implemented.
    There are some challenges from this analysis, with the goals to sell product to 49 states, some products provide significantly low margin rate compare to other.
    The company have to use the opportunity of selling high margin items that will contribute on higher sales.
    The next problem is selling product to 49 states create huge overhead cost for the company. 
    People who ordered small quantity of items in small town in the United States will cost the company more shipping and operation fees. 
    The company have to target and group some of the smaller customer to create more efficient operating cost.
